===============

A set of Microsoft .NET example implementations of the GFIPM Web Services SIPs.  There
are three main projects that comprise these .NET examples.

  - CryptographicTrustFabric - This project is a utility that helps to manage the 
     GFIPM Cryptographic Trust Fabric upon which GFIPM Web Services rely for determining
     what systems to trust.

  - Model1 - This project implements the GFIPM Consumer-Provider SIP.

  - Model2 - This project implements the GFIPM User-Consumer-Provider SIP and because 
      it relies on the Assertion Delegate Service SIP it includes a sample implementation
      of the ADS.
